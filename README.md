## Reinforcement Learning algorithms for robotic applications

Cart-Pole implements an actor-critic competitive function approximation to control a cart-pole. 

GridWorld implements SARSA, Q-learning, policy iteration and action-value iteration in a simple Grid-World scenario where an agent has to reach a predefined cell. 

Function approximation contains approximation techniques with Gaussian processes and Competitive Function Approximation. 

The inverted pendulum is controlled with Gaussian Mixture Models and a variable resolution. 

Optimal Control applies the iLQG algorithm to control the inverted pendulum. 

Optimization implements Gradient Ascent to find extrema in a function.
